w can we define what does sort means?


- a list of a single element is already sorted
- a list of two elements is sorted if the first element is lesser than the second
- a list of three elements is sorted if the first is lesser than the second and the second is lesser than the third, otherwise it is not sorted
- a list of four elements is sorted if the first is lesser than the second and the second is lesser than the third, and the third is lesser than the fourth


==> a list of n element is sorted if the first element is first is lesser than the first element of the tail, and the tail is a sorted list


How can we define the sort process

sort (single element list) => same list
sort of an ordered list => same list
sort of an unordered List => a different list, that is sorted, and has the same elements
the first element of a sorted list is the lesser element of 

the first element of a sorted list => the element lesser than all the element in the list
